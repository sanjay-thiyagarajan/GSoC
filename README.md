### Project Description  

Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System (LORIS) is a web-based data and project management software for neuroimaging research studies. It is an open source framework for storing and processing behavioral, clinical, neuroimaging and genetic data.
  
LORIS also makes it easy to manage large datasets acquired over time in a longitudinal study, or at different locations in a large multi-site study.

#### Deliverables

- Improving existing LORIS Codebase and API features 
- Develop additional features based on the need
- Documentation for the new changes to the pre-existing code and issues
- Fixes for existing API and module bugs
- Deliver feature requests based on requirements

## Overall Experience  
It was an incredible opportunity to contribute to the LORIS project as part of the Google Summer of Code program. My focus was primarily on enhancing the "Issue Tracker" module. With the guidance and support of my mentors, who proved to be exceptionally knowledgeable and encouraging, I embarked on this journey of innovation and collaboration. Throughout the program, I honed my skills in PHP, React, and SQL, gaining hands-on experience in developing and refining the issue tracking functionality. This experience not only deepened my technical expertise but also exposed me to the rewarding dynamics of working within an open-source community. The Google Summer of Code 2023 will forever stand as a pivotal chapter in my journey as a developer, reminding me of the power of teamwork, mentorship, and the endless possibilities that emerge when passion meets technology.
